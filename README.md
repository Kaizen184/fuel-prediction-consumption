# fuel-prediction-consumption

The objective of this project is to predict the fuel efficiency of vehicles (MPG) based on the other information about the vehicles. 
To do this, I used a historical continuous data on MPG based on the fuel efficiency of each vehicle from the 70s to the 80s.
 

In order to accomplish this, I need to create an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline . Once the pipeline is designed and implemented, it will be submitted to the company's lead data scientist for prediction purposes.

Here are the steps I will take to build my pipeline:

 1. Data Collection: I will use the  Auto MPG dataset obtained from the UCI ML Repository.
 2. Data Exploration: This will be done to identify the most important features and combine them in new ways.
 3. Data Preprocessing: Lay out a pipeline of tasks for transforming data for use in my machine learning model.
 4. Model selection & Hyperparameter Tuning : Cross-validate a few models and fine-tune hyperparameters for 
    models that showed promising predictions.
 5. Model Assessment: Determine the performance of the final trained model.
 6. A feature importance analysis
 7. Conclusion & recommendations
